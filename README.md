# About Me

Hey! Some of my main interests are:

- **Research**: I love reading and writing about the latest and greatest in tech and cyber. 

- **Programming**: I am not *great* at coding, rather coming from the angle of security, I prefer to have a general understanding of several languages so I can read and analyze code snippits to determine if they are malicious or not. My most comfortable language is Python. I also maintain a Discord bot written in Python.

- **Malware and Software Analysis**: Although an extremely challenging and relatively chaotic field, I enjoy it. I'm not good at it. I still love it. 

- **Data Analysis, Data Mapping, and Machine Learning**: In my undergrad, I was on a research project which combined machine learning with malware analysis. I still pick up projects in this area, more focused on mapping cyber attacks.
